## About

Global Hackathon Series 2019

The Global Hackathon Series was initially started by a small community of technologists with one goal in mind: to develop opportunity wherever possible.

What started as a way for creators to connect and move their ideas forward turned into a global revolution. Soon, innovators from around the world were joining forces to elevate themselves and their platform - all of which was done through Hackathons.

And while we’ve seen lots of changes since the early Hackathon days, one thing has remained the same - innovators are continuing to rise. Innovators rise to meet opportunity, they rise from failure, they rise from all corners of the globe, and they lend a hand to help others rise with them. It’s why the Global Hackathon Series is still going strong to this day, because Hackathons and the opportunities they create allow people to rise, together.
