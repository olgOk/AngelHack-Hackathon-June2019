Global Hackathon Series 2019

The Global Hackathon Series was initially started by a small community of technologists with one goal in mind: to develop opportunity wherever possible.

What started as a way for creators to connect and move their ideas forward turned into a global revolution. Soon, innovators from around the world were joining forces to elevate themselves and their platform - all of which was done through Hackathons.

And while we’ve seen lots of changes since the early Hackathon days, one thing has remained the same - innovators are continuing to rise. Innovators rise to meet opportunity, they rise from failure, they rise from all corners of the globe, and they lend a hand to help others rise with them. It’s why the Global Hackathon Series is still going strong to this day, because Hackathons and the opportunities they create allow people to rise, together.

**About the Project**
===========================

Our main stack of technology we used were [AWS Rekognition][7] and Python programming language.

Our team  decided to tackle a problem of [powerleveling in game industry][8]. The team created an API integrating AWS Rekognition service. It allows game companies to validate gamers identity using a webcam and a database record. It works exactly like face ID: before a gamer can start playing his favourite video game he has to take a short video of his face. The vidoe will be compared to the photo image stored in the database. If it matches the gamer identity is verified, and he can access his acoount. If a gamer trying to avoid playing any levels of the game and usues powerleveling services, basically, he will not be able access his account, verification of the identity will fail.

In short 24 hours we managed to create a demo product, website and a bussiness model. With more time and funding we are certain we can achive magnifiscent results.
